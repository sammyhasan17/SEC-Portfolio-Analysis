# EBITDA Handling Logic
# ===============================================
# If "EBITDA" is directly reported (via the
# EarningsBeforeInterestTaxesDepreciationAndAmortization tag
# in SEC filings), we use that value.
#
# If it's not reported, we estimate EBITDA using the
# standard formula:
#
#     EBITDA = Net Income
#            + Interest
#            + Taxes
#            + Depreciation
#            + Amortization
#
#       (more at bottom)
#
#


# We do NOT use Adjusted EBITDA, because:
# - Adjusted EBITDA is often calculated with additional
#   custom adjustments (e.g., stock compensation,
#   restructuring costs, etc.)
# - These adjustments vary by company and are not standardized
#   in the SEC’s US-GAAP taxonomy
# - Adjusted values are often only available in press releases
#   or investor presentations, not in machine-readable XBRL data


# ===============================================
Configuration Notes:
# ===============================================
if the program stops working:

-resave the same excel file to same location (Overwrite)

-Make sure file isn't being accessed by other programs

-Multiple Excel windows could affect VBA program in an unexpected way, close them


Test above scenarios and find a way to not have to resave file or have a script to resave itself in the VBA code

How I fixed main issue:
The file could not be found and I would need to overwrite (save as again) for it to work, but thats because Python couldnt find it using the path I put into the script but since It was in same project file, when i saved-as python could read it without needing the absolute path. Abslute path is better.

# ===============================================
Calculation Notes
# ===============================================
Q4 can be found by the following logic: Annual - Q3 - Q2 - Q1 = Q4
Gross Margin is rounded to nearest integer

Net Cashflow from operations = Net cash used in operating activities


Calculations of EBITDA could also be:(for verification)
 EBITDA = Net Sales
       – Operating Expenses (excluding D&A)

# ===============================================
Assumptions
# ===============================================
We assume comparing the best way is to use the most recent SEC filings from each company rather than aligning by fiscal quarter,
because our dashboard is updated quarterly with new data.
This approach ensures we're comparing performance across similar calendar windows,
even though companies may operate on different fiscal calendars.
